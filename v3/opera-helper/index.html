<body>
  <h1>One Last Step - Open in Opera</h1>
  <p>For the extension to open links in the Opera browser, there is one extra step. Please download, unzip and install this open-source native client.</p>
  <ul id="steps">
    <li class="step1">Click <a href="#" data-cmd="download">here</a> to download the package for your operating system (Window, Mac, and Linux are currently supported; Chrome OS is not yet supported) or click <a href="https://github.com/andy-portmen/native-client/releases" target="_blank">here</a> to browse all available download options.</li>
    <li>Extract the downloaded package in a local folder</li>
    <li class="linux">Now open a terminal the root folder which contains <code>install.sh</code> and <code>uninstall.sh</code> and run <code>./install.sh</code>. Alternatively, drop the <code>install.sh</code> file into the terminal and press the Enter key</li>
    <li class="windows">Now double-click the <code>install.bat</code> file</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="flex">
    <input type="button" data-cmd="check" value="Check Connection">
  </div>
  <p class="note canhide">The installer script copies a few files to two different locations for your browser to be able to detect this native client. If you already have NodeJS in your system, the installed version of NodeJS will be used. So please make sure you have an up-to-date version of NodeJS installed. If you don't have this application, the portable version will be used. Read more <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/andy-portmen/native-client">here</a>.</p>
  <p class="note canhide">To completely remove this native client, run <code class="linux">./uninstall.sh</code><code class="windows">uninstall.bat</code>.</p>
  <p class="note">To make sure the native client is accessible, click on the "<a href="#" data-cmd="check">Check Connection</a>" button. <span id="alternative">If you still get this page even when the "Check Button" reports successful connection, it means the application cannot be accessed (path is not correct in the <a href="#" data-cmd="options">options page</a>)</span>. If the path to the executable is correct and the native client is connected, you can debug the connection by enabling console logs in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chromium.org/for-testers/enable-logging">Chrome and Opera</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Browser_Console">Firefox</a>.</p>
